Certified with top marks at UCLA for MERN stack (MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, React, Node) and GraphQL. Have worked with startups including Mixotype, and companies like ExRx and People's Care. Known as an innovative problem solver, developer friends go to me when they are stuck or have startup ideas. My strong points are jQuery, React, PHP, Express JS, and Node. My strength is in listening to business requirements and translating them into real products. In the future I'd like to take a more entrepreneurship and management role combining healthcare and programming in the hospital setting, as I saw a need for charting software made by healthcare professionals.</p>
